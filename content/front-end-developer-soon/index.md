I am learning Front-End Development.

Every blogger has a moment on their life where they stop writing for a few months. It has happened to me.

If I analyze the cause, I didn’t feel motivated because I don’t want to put more hours into mobile games.

I am still playing video games, but the game industry does not attract me anymore.

I believe that learning how to program is going to be as important as speaking English. Everything in our lives is impacted by a computer in one way or the other, and right now is so easy to learn how to program that is a no-brainer to at least get a basic knowledge of computers.

I also found that when I was doing the redesign of the blog, I spent many hours changing stuff and I really enjoyed, so I enrolled in some courses to get more skills and I found that I really like web design and Front-End development.

Now, don’t get me wrong, I am still a newbie, but there is enough content that you can easily get a good grasp of what is  Front-End Development for a few dollars.

My end goal is to get a job as a Front-End Developer in Ottawa, and the blog is going to reflect this hustle, plus some other things like side projects, resources etc…

I feel lucky because where I live right now, Ottawa is living a boom in the tech industry, from Machine Learning to autonomous car, or companies like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/). There is a lot of opportunities, and I know that if I put the work, and I can get into the industry.

I still probably talk about video games sometimes, but I want to let you know that it won't be the main topic of the blog.

There is a lot of websites that are putting out incredible content about video games, I recommend you to subscribe to the following depending on what are your interests.
