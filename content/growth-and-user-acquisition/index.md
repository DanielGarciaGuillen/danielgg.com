Hi there!

My name is Daniel GG and I am glad you are here.

After a year helping Indie Game Developers understand the marketing side of video games (in Spanish), I decided to change the focus of the blog.

I am going to focus on Growth and User Acquisition with special attention to mobile games.

I want to reflect here all my learning to give a hint to all the people who is interested in growth.

It is hard to be on top of the new strategies, the technology is going so fast that strategies used 3 months ago are no longer valid.

That's why in this blog you will find in-depth essays about Growth and User Acquisition. I am not going to show you a special trick that will increase in x% your user base. Instead, the focus of the blog is helping you establish processes to help you get a long term increase of the metrics.

If you think this subject is interesting to you...
