I am super happy to announce that since last August I am working as a remote junior front end developer!

A quick update!

After more than a year learning HTML, CSS, [JavaScript](https://danielgg.com/you-dont-know-js-series-up-running/) and React, I joined an amazing startup.

Honestly, it hasn't been easy. The interview process to get a job as a junior developer is full of rejection and self doubt. The key is to keep going.

I will create a post sharing my experience regards finding your opportunity in the field.

I am not only stocked by the mission of the company, but also the support I get from my coworkers and leadership.

It's not easy to be a junior developer being remote, but since joining the company, I have learned much much more that I would have learned by myself.

[Rewatt Power](https://www.rewattpower.com/https://www.rewattpower.com) is the company that give me the change to prove myself. Based in Calgary, Alberta (CA) we are trying to simplifying complexity in the power markets.

Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or Twitter if you have any questions!

I am grateful for the opportunity, and I am going to make it worth it.
