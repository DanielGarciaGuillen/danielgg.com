Hey guys!

This post is a short one. More a reminder to myself than some really useful to the world.

When you are on your code editor and you need to reference another document, these are the commands you can use to find it.

Starting with "/" returns to the root directory and starts there.

Starting with "./" gives you access to the same directory you are in.

Starting with "../" moves one directory backwards and starts there.

Starting with "../../" moves two directories backwards and starts there.

To move forward, just start with the first subdirectory and keep moving forward.

That's it!

Hope you never get lost again in your directory.
